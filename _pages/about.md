Empowering Education Through Innovation, Leadership, and Science

As an educator, leader, and researcher, I’m passionate about using technology and science to transform learning. My journey spans classrooms, labs, leadership roles, and academic research—all focused on making education more engaging, accessible, and future-ready.

Currently, I’m pursuing a PhD in Education, researching practical, ethical, and effective ways to integrate educational technology. My goal is to move beyond trendy tools and provide educators with meaningful, research-backed strategies.

I’ve taught Biology, Chemistry, ICT, and General Science across Ontario, BC, and British curricula, always prioritizing interactive lesson design and authentic assessment. As a Vice Principal, I led curriculum development, staff mentoring, and student support—fostering collaborative and high-impact school environments.

With a strong foundation in biotechnology (molecular biology, bioprocessing, and bioinformatics), I bridge science and education. My work in EdTech includes building digital tools, managing Moodle, and training staff to use technology purposefully and inclusively.

Certified to teach in British Columbia and working toward Ontario certification, I also hold legal work rights in Malaysia and China.

I’m always eager to collaborate with professionals committed to innovative, inclusive education—because learning should do more than inform; it should empower.
